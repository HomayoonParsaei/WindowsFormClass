# C# Naming Conventions for Methods and Variables

## 1. Methods (Start with a **verb**)
- Methods represent actions, so they should typically start with a verb.
- Use **PascalCase** (capitalize each word).

### Examples:
- `CalculateTotal()`
- `GetUserData()`
- `SaveToDatabase()`

## 2. Variables (Start with a **noun**)
- Variables represent data or objects, so they should generally start with a noun.
- Use **camelCase** (the first letter lowercase and capitalize each subsequent word).

### Examples:
- `totalAmount`
- `userName`
- `orderList`

## General Naming Conventions:
- **Properties**: Typically nouns or noun phrases, using PascalCase, like `UserAge`, `OrderStatus`.
- **Private Fields**: Can use `_camelCase`, for example, `_orderId`, `_userData`.

By following these patterns, your code will be consistent and easier to read.
