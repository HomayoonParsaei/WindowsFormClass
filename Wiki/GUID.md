# GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)


A GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify objects or entities across systems. It is often represented as a string in the form of 32 hexadecimal characters separated by hyphens.

###### GUID is the Microsoft-specific implementation of UUID

## Format of a GUID

A GUID is typically represented in this format:

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx


Where:
- `x` is a hexadecimal digit (0-9 or A-F).
- `M` defines the version of the GUID algorithm.
- `N` defines the variant of the GUID (related to the GUID generation method).

## GUID Versions

### 1. **Version 1 (Time-based)**
- Generated using the current timestamp and the MAC address of the machine.
- Timestamp ensures uniqueness over time, and the MAC address ensures uniqueness across machines.

### 2. **Version 3 (Namespace-based, MD5 hash)**
- Generated by applying an MD5 hash on a namespace identifier and a name (string).
- Guarantees that the same name in the same namespace will always produce the same GUID.

### 3. **Version 4 (Random-based)**
- Generated using random numbers.
- The most commonly used version in many applications.
- Offers 122 bits of randomness (128 bits total, with 6 bits reserved for version and variant).

### 4. **Version 5 (Namespace-based, SHA-1 hash)**
- Similar to Version 3, but uses the SHA-1 hash algorithm instead of MD5.

## GUID Generation in C#

In C#, you can generate a GUID using the `Guid.NewGuid()` method, which generates a Version 4 GUID (random-based):

```csharp
Guid newGuid = Guid.NewGuid();
Console.WriteLine(newGuid.ToString());
```
This will generate a unique identifier like:

b2b37d8a-e16a-40e5-9a2b-8c374e002d5e
