# Access Modifiers in C#

In C#, access modifiers determine the visibility of classes, methods, properties, and other members. Here’s a comparison of the different access modifiers:

| Access Modifier | Description                                                        | Access Level                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **public**       | The member is accessible from any other code.                     | - No restrictions on access.<br>- Can be accessed from any class or assembly.                                                                      |
| **private**      | The member is accessible only within its own class.               | - Restricts access to the containing class only.<br>- Cannot be accessed from outside the class or derived classes.                               |
| **protected**    | The member is accessible within its own class and derived classes. | - Allows access to the containing class and any subclasses, regardless of assembly.<br>- Not accessible from instances of the class.              |
| **internal**     | The member is accessible only within its own assembly.            | - Accessible to any code in the same assembly.<br>- Not accessible from another assembly.                                                           |
| **protected internal** | The member is accessible from the same assembly or derived classes. | - Combines the behavior of `protected` and `internal` access.<br>- Can be accessed by derived classes and any class within the same assembly.     |
| **private protected** | The member is accessible only within its own class and derived classes within the same assembly. | - Introduced in C# 7.2.<br>- More restrictive than `protected`, allowing access only from derived classes in the same assembly.                    |

## Summary

- Use **public** for members that should be accessible from anywhere.
- Use **private** for members that should only be accessed within the same class.
- Use **protected** for members that should be accessible in derived classes.
- Use **internal** for members that should be accessible only within the same assembly.
- Use **protected internal** when you want a member to be accessible from derived classes or the same assembly.
- Use **private protected** when you want a member to be accessible only within the same class and derived classes in the same assembly.
